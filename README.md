## About The Project

As the world community has come to understand the significance of advancing gender equality and safeguarding women's rights, the complicated subject of women's safety has received more attention in recent years. Women's safety is a basic human right and an essential element of sustainable development.

Unfortunately, many countries throughout the world, including India, continue to have serious concerns about the protection of women. Women regardless of ages, colors, and socioeconomic origins experience violence against them as well as sexual harassment and discrimination based on gender.

The protection of women has long been a concern in India due to the high rates of violence against them, notably sexual and rape assault. Numerous high-profile incidents involving assault against women have occurred in India in recent years, and this has caused the problem to get a lot of notice.

The Indian government took action to address the problem of women's safety, enacting new laws and regulations intended to stop crime against women and safeguard their rights. Implementing and enforcing these rules and regulations, however, continues to be difficult. The issue of women's security within India is exacerbated by patriarchal societal standards, a lack of economic and educational possibilities for women, and insufficient legal and law enforcement systems to deter and address violence against women. Women's safety initiatives in India and throughout the world must take a multifaceted strategy that includes outreach and education campaigns, changes to laws and policies, and increased funding for initiatives and services that encourage women's empowerment and uphold their rights.

The government has put in place several safety precautions to stop this kind of rebellion, but they haven't had much of an impact on the rise in these crimes, which has remained constant. It seems reasonable to provide a tool that aids women in successfully resolving this issue. Due to the significant increase in smartphone capability in today's culture, a smartphone may be effectively employed for personal security or any other type of protection. Due to the alarming number of events, many persons have now been informed of the urgent need to address safety issues. As a result, several initiatives have been established to provide women with accessibility to protective devices via their cellphones. The primary goal of the woman safety alert system is to provide a quick way to get in touch with assistance. By way of message and position tracking, this also contains the nearest family members, police stations, and drug users. Smart gadgets like smartwatches can also be used to make future improvements to this procedure. With only one click, this application uses GPS to find a location, communicates the location URL to the registered cellphone number, and phones the first person on the list to assist the individual in need.

India, which views itself as a implicit superpower and global profitable mecca, can only succeed in its development pretensions if and when a sizable portion of the population is made up of women. This essay examines the main conditions for an intelligence security system, including the specialized conditions and system- structure obstacles. As such an circumstance canâ€™t be prognosticated, it's stylish to reduce the liability of physical abuse (thievery, sexual assault, etc.) by having all safety- related instruments at the ready. This lowers peril and provides help when it's needed. Indeed though these situations may include innocent men, in some of these cases, these men end their lives by committing self-murder. Social networking is a part of our lives as well as a tool for women draining by participating insulting photos shot by retired cameras.
